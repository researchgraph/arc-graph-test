ARC Centre of Excellence for the Mathematical Analysis of Cellular Systems. The ARC Centre for the Mathematical Analysis of Cellular Systems aims to deliver the mathematics required to compute life. The Centre will deliver innovation in computational and mathematical biology and establish in silico biology alongside in vivo and in vitro biology. These models will allow us to understand the complexity of life at the cellular level and enable new ways of combining diverse and heterogenous data. This will allow us to understand the mechanisms underlying cellular behaviour, and to apply rational design engineering methods in order to control the dynamics of biological systems.

Our research will inform Alps-wide management efforts designed for long-term success.", "funding-current": 1235370.0, "funding-at-announcement": 1231305, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Adrienne", "familyName": "Nicotra", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-6578-369X "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Matthew", "familyName": "Brookhouse", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-1127-255X "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Saul", "familyName": "Cunningham", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-0703-6893 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Owen", "familyName": "Atkin", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-1041-5202 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "James", "familyName": "Pittock", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-6293-996X "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Benjamin", "familyName": "Smith", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-6987-5337 "}, {"title": "Ms", "firstName": "Mellesa", "familyName": "Schroder", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-6178-0109 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Rosie", "familyName": "Cooney", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-8384-8469 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Josh", "familyName": "Dorrough", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Paul", "familyName": "Miller", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-1105-2132 "}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Adrienne", "familyName": "Nicotra", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-6578-369X "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Matthew", "familyName": "Brookhouse", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-1127-255X "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Saul", "familyName": "Cunningham", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-0703-6893 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Owen", "familyName": "Atkin", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-1041-5202 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "James", "familyName": "Pittock", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-6293-996X "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Benjamin", "familyName": "Smith", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-6987-5337 "}, {"title": "Ms", "firstName": "Mellesa", "familyName": "Schroder", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-6178-0109 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Rosie", "familyName": "Cooney", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-8384-8469 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Josh", "familyName": "Dorrough", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Paul", "familyName": "Miller", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-1105-2132 "}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "The Australian National University", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "ACT"}, {"organisationName": "Western Sydney University", "roleName": "Other Eligible Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND ENVIRONMENT", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate -

We will utilise new technologies that allow us, for the first time, to determine the position of hydrogen atoms around micro-scale features and to compare it to local mechanical behaviour, determined by micro-mechanical tests. The systematic investigation of the effect of hydrogen on different micro-components within steel will allow the development of microstructure-guided alloy design principles.", "funding-current":

This project aims to develop novel approaches to realise the value of the graph of graphs (GoG), which has been widely used to capture the relations among the structured entities.

The project will bring new scientific findings, key technological step-change solutions, unlocking the full potential of perovskites for cheaper photovoltaic technologies.\n", "funding-current": 801930.0, "funding-at-announcement": 798379, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Xiaojing", "familyName": "Hao", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-5903-4481 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Hieu", "familyName": "Nguyen", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-1667-1135 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Martin", "familyName": "Green", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Jae Sung", "familyName": "Yun", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-1882-7052 "}, {"title": "Mr", "firstName": "Ewan", "familyName": "Norton-Smith", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Mr", "firstName": "Daniel", "familyName": "Fraser", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Mr", "firstName": "Nick", "familyName": "Morley", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Xiaojing", "familyName": "Hao", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-5903-4481 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Hieu", "familyName": "Nguyen", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-1667-1135 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Martin", "familyName": "Green", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Jae Sung", "familyName": "Yun", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-1882-7052 "}, {"title": "Mr", "firstName": "Ewan", "familyName": "Norton-Smith", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Mr", "firstName": "Daniel", "familyName": "Fraser", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Mr", "firstName": "Nick", "familyName": "Morley", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "The University of New South Wales", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "The Australian National University", "roleName": "Other Eligible Organisation", "state": "ACT"}, {"organisationName": "University of Surrey", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": "N/A"}, {"organisationName": "IRONSIDE CAPITAL PTY LTD", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": "WA"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "The University of New South Wales", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "The Australian National University", "roleName": "Other Eligible Organisation", "state": "ACT"}, {"organisationName": "University of Surrey", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": "N/A"}, {"organisationName": "IRONSIDE CAPITAL PTY LTD", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": "WA"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": true, "code": "0906", "name": "Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "090605", "name": "Photodetectors, Optical Sensors and Solar Cells", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "091205", "name": "Functional Materials", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "100712", "name": "Nanoscale Characterisation", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "850504", "name": "Solar-Photovoltaic Energy", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "970109", "name": "Expanding Knowledge In Engineering", "type": "SEO08"}], "international-collaboration": ["England"], "lief-register": [], "achievement-summary": null}}}, {"links": {"self": "https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/LP210301314"}, "data": {"type": "grant-details", "id": "LP210301314", "attributes": {"code": "LP210301314", "administering-organisation": "Monash University", "announcement-administering-organisation": "Monash University", "scheme-name": "Linkage Projects", "grant-status": "Active", "funding-commencement-year": 2022, "years-funded": 4, "project-start-date": "2022-07-01", "anticipated-end-date": "2026-06-30", "grant-summary": "Smart Irrigation: integrating UAV soil moisture maps & variable rate sprays.

Carbon Conversion.

Electrification of carbon conversion processes can overcome this hurdle by providing this energy via renewables. This project aims to develop an electrically powered energy efficient catalytic process for carbon conversion. A modular 3-D printed monolithic catalytic reactor prototype powered by induction or resistive heating will be developed to minimise energy loss in the carbon conversion process.

This project aims to transform Australia\u2019s timber and construction sectors by stimulating rapid growth in timber innovation and uptake of use of timber in buildings. It plans to enable this transformation by addressing the diverse elements required to motivate investment, stimulate innovation, satisfy stakeholder demands, define long-term social-environmental-economic benefits and establish a roadmap for change. The expected outcomes will kickstart the change process, supported by growth in advanced manufacturing across the value chain. This should provide significant benefits in stimulating an opportunity for regional development and resource diversification whilst helping the sectors transition to a circular and net-zero economy.",

Expected outcomes include 2-dimensional catalysts made from earth-abundant elements lowering large-scale production cost, a novel but reliable working principle based on reversible carbon dioxide/oxalate conversion, and prototypes featuring high specific capacity, large energy density and excellent durability. Via industrial pilot trials, commercial benefits will be fast tracked for energy security and carbon dioxide utilisation.", "funding-current": 552835.0, "funding-at-announcement": 548000, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Tianyi", "familyName": "Ma", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-1042-8700 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Baohua", "familyName": "Jia", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-6703-477X "}, {"title": "Mr", "firstName": "Stephen", "familyName": "Wee", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Tianyi", "familyName": "Ma", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-1042-8700 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Baohua", "familyName": "Jia", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-6703-477X "}, {"title": "Mr", "firstName": "Stephen", "familyName": "Wee", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "RMIT University", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "VIC"}, {"organisationName": "GRAPHENEX PTY LTD", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": "NSW"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "Swinburne University of Technology", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "VIC"}, {"organisationName": "GRAPHENEX PTY LTD", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": "NSW"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": false, "code": "030601", "name": "Catalysis and Mechanisms of Reactions", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": true, "code": "0912", "name": "Materials Engineering", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "091205", "name": "Functional Materials", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "100708", "name": "Nanomaterials", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "849802", "name": "Management of Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Mineral Resource Activities", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "850602", "name": "Energy Storage (Excl.

The expected outcome is an easy-to-use toolkit (comprising a software suite and low-cost sensors) that can be readily incorporated into hospitality operations. This should provide significant benefits, such as enticing people to go out and visit restaurants, supporting some of Australia\u2019s 600,000 hospitality jobs while fostering Australia\u2019s innovative food culture.", "funding-current": 364603.0, "funding-at-announcement": 360836, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Florian", "familyName": "Mueller", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Mr", "firstName": "Michael", "familyName": "Bascetta", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Florian", "familyName": "Mueller", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Mr", "firstName": "Michael", "familyName": "Bascetta", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "Monash University", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "VIC"}, {"organisationName": "WORKSMITH COWORKING PTY LTD", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": "VIC"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "Monash University", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "VIC"}, {"organisationName": "WORKSMITH COWORKING PTY LTD", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": "VIC"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": true, "code": "0806", "name": "Information Systems", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "080602", "name": "Computer-Human Interaction", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "970108", "name": "Expanding Knowledge In the Information and Computing Sciences", "type": "SEO08"}], "international-collaboration": [], "lief-register": [], "achievement-summary": null}}}, {"links": {"self": "https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/LP210200671"}, "data": {"type": "grant-details", "id": "LP210200671", "attributes": {"code": "LP210200671", "administering-organisation": "The University of New South Wales", "announcement-administering-organisation": "The University of New South Wales", "scheme-name": "Linkage Projects", "grant-status": "Active", "funding-commencement-year": 2022, "years-funded": 3, "project-start-date": "2022-08-01", "anticipated-end-date": "2025-07-31", "grant-summary": "Social isolation and volunteering of older Chinese immigrants in Australia.

This should provide significant benefits, such as profit stability for wheat growers, elevated global market position and improved food security.", "funding-current": 1065591.0, "funding-at-announcement": 1062378, "investigators-current": [{"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Karine", "familyName": "Chenu", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-7273-2057 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Mark", "familyName": "Cooper", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-9418-3359 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Graeme", "familyName": "Hammer", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Lee", "familyName": "Hickey", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-6909-7101 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "John", "familyName": "Christopher", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-8873-1059 "}, {"title": "Adj A/Prof", "firstName": "Haydn", "familyName": "Kuchel", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Tristan", "familyName": "Coram", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Adam", "familyName": "Norman", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-0794-4907 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "James", "familyName": "Walter", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-4708-497X "}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Karine", "familyName": "Chenu", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-7273-2057 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Mark", "familyName": "Cooper", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-9418-3359 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Graeme", "familyName": "Hammer", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Lee", "familyName": "Hickey", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-6909-7101 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "John", "familyName": "Christopher", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-8873-1059 "}, {"title": "Adj A/Prof", "firstName": "Haydn", "familyName": "Kuchel", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Tristan", "familyName": "Coram", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Adam", "familyName": "Norman", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-0794-4907 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "James", "familyName": "Walter", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-4708-497X "}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "The University of Queensland", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "QLD"}, {"organisationName": "AUSTRALIAN GRAIN TECHNOLOGIES PTY LTD", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": "SA"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "The University of Queensland", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "QLD"}, {"organisationName": "AUSTRALIAN GRAIN TECHNOLOGIES PTY LTD", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": "SA"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": false, "code": "060412", "name": "Quantitative Genetics (Incl.

This  study will determine if macrophage subtypes acts to coordinate regeneration in other tissues and systems and if a programable pro-regenerative cell can be made in vitro that stimulate regeneration in different settings.", "funding-current": 865547.0, "funding-at-announcement": 857800, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Peter", "familyName": "Currie", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Mika\u00ebl", "familyName": "Martino", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-5012-4605 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Ryan", "familyName": "Hicks", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Peter", "familyName": "Currie", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Mika\u00ebl", "familyName": "Martino", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-5012-4605 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Ryan", "familyName": "Hicks", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "Monash University", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "VIC"}, {"organisationName": "AstraZeneca, Sweden", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": null}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "AstraZeneca, Sweden", "roleName": "Partner Organisation", "state": null}, {"organisationName": "Monash University", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "VIC"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": true, "code": "0601", "name": "Biochemistry and Cell Biology", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "060199", "name": "Biochemistry and Cell Biology Not Elsewhere Classified", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "860999", "name": "Veterinary Pharmaceutical Products Not Elsewhere Classified", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "970106", "name": "Expanding Knowledge In the Biological Sciences", "type": "SEO08"}], "international-collaboration": ["Sweden"], "lief-register": [], "achievement-summary": null}}}, {"links": {"self": "https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/LP210200917"}, "data": {"type": "grant-details", "id": "LP210200917", "attributes": {"code": "LP210200917", "administering-organisation": "The University of Melbourne", "announcement-administering-organisation": "The University of Melbourne", "scheme-name": "Linkage Projects", "grant-status": "Active", "funding-commencement-year": 2022, "years-funded": 3, "project-start-date": "2022-01-01", "anticipated-end-date": "2024-12-31", "grant-summary": "AI for Legal Problem Diagnosis in the Diverse Language of Australians.

This will provide practical solutions to address not only Australia's glass recycling crisis but also the worldwide issue of disposal of waste glass.", "funding-current": 419884.0, "funding-at-announcement": 416000, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Zhong", "familyName": "Tao", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-2117-2162 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Wengui", "familyName": "Li", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Zhong", "familyName": "Tao", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-2117-2162 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Wengui", "familyName": "Li", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "Western Sydney University", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "University of Technology Sydney", "roleName": "Other Eligible Organisation", "state": "NSW"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "Western Sydney University", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "University of Technology Sydney", "roleName": "Other Eligible Organisation", "state": "NSW"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": true, "code": "0905", "name": "Civil Engineering", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "090503", "name": "Construction Materials", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "090506", "name": "Structural Engineering", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "870201", "name": "Civil Construction Design", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "870301", "name": "Cement and Concrete Materials", "type": "SEO08"}], "international-collaboration": [], "lief-register": [], "achievement-summary": null}}}, {"links": {"self": "https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP220100040"}, "data": {"type": "grant-details", "id": "DP220100040", "attributes": {"code": "DP220100040", "administering-organisation": "The University of New South Wales", "announcement-administering-organisation": "The University of New South Wales", "scheme-name": "Discovery Projects", "grant-status": "Active", "funding-commencement-year": 2022, "years-funded": 3, "project-start-date": "2022-01-01", "anticipated-end-date": "2024-12-31", "grant-summary": "Punishment learning: from cells to circuits to behaviour.

The outcomes will be applied across a range of industries of vital importance to Australian economic and technological future.", "funding-current": 393531.0, "funding-at-announcement": 390000, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Yansong", "familyName": "Shen", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-8472-8805 "}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Mikio", "familyName": "Sakai", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Stefan", "familyName": "Pirker", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Yansong", "familyName": "Shen", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-8472-8805 "}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Mikio", "familyName": "Sakai", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Stefan", "familyName": "Pirker", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "The University of New South Wales", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "University of Tokyo", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}, {"organisationName": "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "The University of New South Wales", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "University of Tokyo", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}, {"organisationName": "Johannes Kepler University of Linz", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": false, "code": "090406", "name": "Powder and Particle Technology", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": true, "code": "0914", "name": "Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "091407", "name": "Pyrometallurgy", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "840204", "name": "Mining and Extraction of Iron Ores", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "900402", "name": "Waste Recycling Services", "type": "SEO08"}], "international-collaboration": ["Austria", "Japan"], "lief-register": [], "achievement-summary": null}}}, {"links": {"self": "https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP220100307"}, "data": {"type": "grant-details", "id": "DP220100307", "attributes": {"code": "DP220100307", "administering-organisation": "Curtin University", "announcement-administering-organisation": "Curtin University", "scheme-name": "Discovery Projects", "grant-status": "Active", "funding-commencement-year": 2022, "years-funded": 3, "project-start-date": "2022-01-01", "anticipated-end-date": "2024-12-31", "grant-summary": "Development of Novel Metaconcrete to Resist Impulsive Loads.

The project will examine critically this intellectual formation, exploring its potential in global health and revealing its blind spots and omissions, especially in relation to Indigenous knowledge and structural inequalities.", "funding-current": 672148.0, "funding-at-announcement": 666897, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Warwick", "familyName": "Anderson", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-2572-035X "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Jakelin", "familyName": "Troy", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Anthony", "familyName": "Capon", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Sverker", "familyName": "S\u00f6rlin", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-2864-2315 "}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Warwick", "familyName": "Anderson", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-2572-035X "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Jakelin", "familyName": "Troy", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Anthony", "familyName": "Capon", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Sverker", "familyName": "S\u00f6rlin", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-2864-2315 "}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "The University of Sydney", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "Monash University", "roleName": "Other Eligible Organisation", "state": "VIC"}, {"organisationName": "Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "The University of Sydney", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "Monash University", "roleName": "Other Eligible Organisation", "state": "VIC"}, {"organisationName": "Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": false, "code": "169902", "name": "Studies of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Society", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": true, "code": "2103", "name": "Historical Studies", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "210399", "name": "Historical Studies Not Elsewhere Classified", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "220205", "name": "History and Philosophy of Medicine", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "920405", "name": "Environmental Health", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "960311", "name": "Social Impacts of Climate Change and Variability", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "970121", "name": "Expanding Knowledge In History and Archaeology", "type": "SEO08"}], "international-collaboration": ["England", "Sweden", "United States of America"], "lief-register": [], "achievement-summary": null}}}, {"links": {"self": "https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP220100627"}, "data": {"type": "grant-details", "id": "DP220100627", "attributes": {"code": "DP220100627", "administering-organisation": "The University of Queensland", "announcement-administering-organisation": "The University of Queensland", "scheme-name": "Discovery Projects", "grant-status": "Active", "funding-commencement-year": 2022, "years-funded": 3, "project-start-date": "2022-03-31", "anticipated-end-date": "2025-03-30", "grant-summary": "Balance of Power vs. Empire in International Relations: A Global Study. Why have some international systems seen power-balancing between competing Great Powers, while others have been dominated by a single empire?

Yet recent analyses of East Asia highlight the historical dominance of successive Chinese empires. Other, neglected regional systems vary between these extremes. IR scholars lack an explanation of when and why international systems tend towards balance of power or empire. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap.

In this project, we aim to answer the question: was the scale of these fires driven by known drivers of fire (drought, weather, fuels and ignitions), or were fundamentally new undescribed processes and phenomena involved?  We will accomplish this by developing an innovative, physics-aware machine learning model of fire risk and spread, trained and validated on a two-decade satellite fire record.  The predictive ability of the model will be tested on the 2019/20 fire season to determine if novel drivers of fire can be identified, and the model itself will be operationalised into a novel short-to-mid term fire risk prediction tool.

This should provide significant benefits, such as science-based evidence to ratify the Minamata Convention on Mercury and guide new regulations to reduce environmental/health risks from metal pollution.\n", "funding-current": 412552.0, "funding-at-announcement": 409193, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Larissa", "familyName": "Schneider", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Simon", "familyName": "Haberle", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-5802-6535 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Krystyna", "familyName": "Saunders", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-6800-2630 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Stephen", "familyName": "Roberts", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-3407-9127 "}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Ruoyu", "familyName": "Sun", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-7261-8377 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Alan", "familyName": "Griffiths", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-1135-1810 "}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Larissa", "familyName": "Schneider", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Simon", "familyName": "Haberle", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-5802-6535 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Krystyna", "familyName": "Saunders", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-6800-2630 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Stephen", "familyName": "Roberts", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-3407-9127 "}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Ruoyu", "familyName": "Sun", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-7261-8377 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Alan", "familyName": "Griffiths", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-1135-1810 "}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "The Australian National University", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "ACT"}, {"organisationName": "Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "British Antarctic Survey", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}, {"organisationName": "Tianjin University, China", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "The Australian National University", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "ACT"}, {"organisationName": "Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "British Antarctic Survey", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}, {"organisationName": "Tianjin University, China", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": false, "code": "039901", "name": "Environmental Chemistry (Incl.

This should provide significant benefits, by improving emotion communication and offering a new perspective on how artificial intelligence can best serve human social needs.\n", "funding-current": 448099.0, "funding-at-announcement": 444914, "investigators-current": [{"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Romina", "familyName": "Palermo", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-8678-4592 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Amy", "familyName": "Dawel", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-6668-3121 "}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Jason", "familyName": "Bell", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-1583-5292 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Clare", "familyName": "Sutherland", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-0443-3412 "}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Eva", "familyName": "Krumhuber", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-1894-2517 "}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Romina", "familyName": "Palermo", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-8678-4592 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Amy", "familyName": "Dawel", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-6668-3121 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Clare", "familyName": "Sutherland", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-0443-3412 "}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Jason", "familyName": "Bell", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-1583-5292 "}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Eva", "familyName": "Krumhuber", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-1894-2517 "}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "The University of Western Australia", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "WA"}, {"organisationName": "The Australian National University", "roleName": "Other Eligible Organisation", "state": "ACT"}, {"organisationName": "University of Aberdeen", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}, {"organisationName": "University College London", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "The University of Western Australia", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "WA"}, {"organisationName": "The Australian National University", "roleName": "Other Eligible Organisation", "state": "ACT"}, {"organisationName": "University of Aberdeen", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}, {"organisationName": "University College London", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": false, "code": "080602", "name": "Computer-Human Interaction", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": true, "code": "1701", "name": "Psychology", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "170109", "name": "Personality, Abilities and Assessment", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "170112", "name": "Sensory Processes, Perception and Performance", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "970117", "name": "Expanding Knowledge In Psychology and Cognitive Sciences", "type": "SEO08"}], "international-collaboration": ["England", "Scotland", "United States of America"], "lief-register": [], "achievement-summary": null}}}, {"links": {"self": "https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP220101031"}, "data": {"type": "grant-details", "id": "DP220101031", "attributes": {"code": "DP220101031", "administering-organisation": "The University of Sydney", "announcement-administering-organisation": "The University of Sydney", "scheme-name": "Discovery Projects", "grant-status": "Active", "funding-commencement-year": 2022, "years-funded": 3, "project-start-date": "2022-08-01", "anticipated-end-date": "2025-07-31", "grant-summary": "Employment Relations in Indonesia\u2019s Commercial Fishing Industry.

It could also have profound significance for artificial intelligence and brain-inspired technologies, as well as benefit neural sensory prostheses and brain-machine interfaces.", "funding-current": 484346.0, "funding-at-announcement": 480000, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Anthony", "familyName": "Burkitt", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-5672-2772 "}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Hamish", "familyName": "Meffin", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-4307-6841 "}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Hinze", "familyName": "Hogendoorn", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-8499-8394 "}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Anthony", "familyName": "Burkitt", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-5672-2772 "}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Hamish", "familyName": "Meffin", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-4307-6841 "}, {"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Hinze", "familyName": "Hogendoorn", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-8499-8394 "}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "The University of Melbourne", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "VIC"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "The University of Melbourne", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "VIC"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": true, "code": "0801", "name": "Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "080108", "name": "Neural, Evolutionary and Fuzzy Computation", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "110906", "name": "Sensory Systems", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "170112", "name": "Sensory Processes, Perception and Performance", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "970106", "name": "Expanding Knowledge In the Biological Sciences", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "970109", "name": "Expanding Knowledge In Engineering", "type": "SEO08"}], "international-collaboration": [], "lief-register": [], "achievement-summary": null}}}, {"links": {"self": "https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP220101179"}, "data": {"type": "grant-details", "id": "DP220101179", "attributes": {"code": "DP220101179", "administering-organisation": "The University of Queensland", "announcement-administering-organisation": "Monash University", "scheme-name": "Discovery Projects", "grant-status": "Active", "funding-commencement-year": 2022, "years-funded": 3, "project-start-date": "2022-01-01", "anticipated-end-date": "2024-12-31", "grant-summary": "Targeting TGF-beta proteins to control animal reproduction.

The project will develop a state of the art presolvation electron transport model informed by world first measurements of electron cross-sections for radicals and liquids and apply it to model plasma electrochemistry processes.", "funding-current": 363259.0, "funding-at-announcement": 360000, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Ronald", "familyName": "White", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Michael", "familyName": "Brunger", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Yang", "familyName": "Liu", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-2085-5148 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Mark", "familyName": "Kushner", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Ronald", "familyName": "White", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Michael", "familyName": "Brunger", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Mark", "familyName": "Kushner", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Yang", "familyName": "Liu", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-2085-5148 "}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "James Cook University", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "QLD"}, {"organisationName": "Flinders University", "roleName": "Other Eligible Organisation", "state": "SA"}, {"organisationName": "University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan US", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "James Cook University", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "QLD"}, {"organisationName": "Flinders University", "roleName": "Other Eligible Organisation", "state": "SA"}, {"organisationName": "University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan US", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": true, "code": "0202", "name": "Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle and Plasma Physics", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "020201", "name": "Atomic and Molecular Physics", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "020204", "name": "Plasma Physics; Fusion Plasmas; Electrical Discharges", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "970102", "name": "Expanding Knowledge In the Physical Sciences", "type": "SEO08"}], "international-collaboration": ["England", "Serbia", "Spain", "United States of America"], "lief-register": [], "achievement-summary": null}}}, {"links": {"self": "https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP220101489"}, "data": {"type": "grant-details", "id": "DP220101489", "attributes": {"code": "DP220101489", "administering-organisation": "The University of New South Wales", "announcement-administering-organisation": "The University of New South Wales", "scheme-name": "Discovery Projects", "grant-status": "Active", "funding-commencement-year": 2022, "years-funded": 3, "project-start-date": "2022-01-01", "anticipated-end-date": "2024-12-31", "grant-summary": "Transcription factors find their targets by reading the epigenetic code.

The mathematical questions are concerned with the long-time dynamics of equations with free boundary, and the asymptotic profiles of their solutions.\n  ", "funding-current": 407667.0, "funding-at-announcement": 404000, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Yihong", "familyName": "Du", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Yihong", "familyName": "Du", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "The University of New England", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "The University of New England", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": true, "code": "0101", "name": "Pure Mathematics", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "010109", "name": "Ordinary Differential Equations, Difference Equations and Dynamical Systems", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "010110", "name": "Partial Differential Equations", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "970101", "name": "Expanding Knowledge In the Mathematical Sciences", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "970106", "name": "Expanding Knowledge In the Biological Sciences", "type": "SEO08"}], "international-collaboration": ["China (excludes SARs and Taiwan)", "France", "Japan", "Spain", "United States of America"], "lief-register": [], "achievement-summary": null}}}, {"links": {"self": "https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP220101823"}, "data": {"type": "grant-details", "id": "DP220101823", "attributes": {"code": "DP220101823", "administering-organisation": "The University of Sydney", "announcement-administering-organisation": "The University of Sydney", "scheme-name": "Discovery Projects", "grant-status": "Active", "funding-commencement-year": 2022, "years-funded": 3, "project-start-date": "2022-05-24", "anticipated-end-date": "2025-05-23", "grant-summary": "Adaptive and Ubiquitous Trust Framework for Internet of Things interactions.

Outcomes will include unique insight into atomic-level structural details that determine device efficiency and an understanding of whether atomic simulations can be applied to accelerate improvements in device performance and translation to industry.", "funding-current": 568916.0, "funding-at-announcement": 564000, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Paul", "familyName": "Burn", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Em/Prof", "firstName": "Alan", "familyName": "Mark", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-5880-4798 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Paul", "familyName": "Shaw", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-3326-3670 "}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Paul", "familyName": "Burn", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Em/Prof", "firstName": "Alan", "familyName": "Mark", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-5880-4798 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Paul", "familyName": "Shaw", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-3326-3670 "}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "The University of Queensland", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "QLD"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "The University of Queensland", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "QLD"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": true, "code": "0303", "name": "Macromolecular and Materials Chemistry", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "030307", "name": "Theory and Design of Materials", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "030799", "name": "Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Not Elsewhere Classified", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "869899", "name": "Environmentally Sustainable Manufacturing Not Elsewhere Classified", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "970102", "name": "Expanding Knowledge In the Physical Sciences", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "970103", "name": "Expanding Knowledge In the Chemical Sciences", "type": "SEO08"}], "international-collaboration": [], "lief-register": [], "achievement-summary": null}}}, {"links": {"self": "https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP220102125"}, "data": {"type": "grant-details", "id": "DP220102125", "attributes": {"code": "DP220102125", "administering-organisation": "University of Tasmania", "announcement-administering-organisation": "University of Tasmania", "scheme-name": "Discovery Projects", "grant-status": "Active", "funding-commencement-year": 2022, "years-funded": 3, "project-start-date": "2022-01-01", "anticipated-end-date": "2024-12-31", "grant-summary": "Optimising biodiversity conservation in managed forest landscapes.

The outcomes will also advance machine learning knowledge with a new robust meta learning schema for general data analytics and applications.", "funding-current": 498914.0, "funding-at-announcement": 494500, "investigators-current": [{"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Guangquan", "familyName": "Zhang", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Junyu", "familyName": "Xuan", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-8367-6908 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Qian", "familyName": "Zhang", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-9977-8418 "}, {"title": "Prof Dr", "firstName": "Witold", "familyName": "Pedrycz", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "A/Prof", "firstName": "Guangquan", "familyName": "Zhang", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Junyu", "familyName": "Xuan", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-8367-6908 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Qian", "familyName": "Zhang", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-9977-8418 "}, {"title": "Prof Dr", "firstName": "Witold", "familyName": "Pedrycz", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "University of Technology Sydney", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "University of Alberta, Canada", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "University of Technology Sydney", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "University of Alberta, Canada", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": true, "code": "0801", "name": "Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "080108", "name": "Neural, Evolutionary and Fuzzy Computation", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "080109", "name": "Pattern Recognition and Data Mining", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "080605", "name": "Decision Support and Group Support Systems", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "890201", "name": "Application Software Packages (Excl.

This project aims to create a novel bilayer ferroelectric material structure that provides giant electromechanical response at the nano-scale.  Traditional electromechanical devices based on ferroelectric materials including position sensors, mechanical actuators, and ultrasonic transducers rely on bulk form. As technology moves toward integrated functionalities, future electro-mechanical materials need to be scaled down to thin film form.

The biotechnology sector is emerging as an important economic strength in Australia. While the improved efficacy and selectivity of biomolecules has seen them emerge as alternatives to existing chemicals in health and agriculture, the stability of biomolecules remains a major limiting factor. A general strategy for improving protein stability is by joining the ends of the peptide chain in a cyclisation reaction. While a wide range of cyclic peptides and proteins are being developed in Australia and around the world, the cyclisation reaction presents a significant challenge.

The research outcomes can also be used to maintain workplace safety in mining environments and avoid disruptions to production.\n", "funding-current": 457427.0, "funding-at-announcement": 453000, "investigators-current": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Jinsong", "familyName": "Huang", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-5159-1635 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Anna", "familyName": "Giacomini", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-5115-3216 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Andrei", "familyName": "Lyamin", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Marc", "familyName": "Elmouttie", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-3544-5897 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Jingjing", "familyName": "Meng", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-0148-9779 "}], "investigators-at-announcement": [{"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Jinsong", "familyName": "Huang", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0002-5159-1635 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Anna", "familyName": "Giacomini", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0001-5115-3216 "}, {"title": "Prof", "firstName": "Andrei", "familyName": "Lyamin", "roleName": "Chief Investigator", "roleCode": "CI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": null}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Marc", "familyName": "Elmouttie", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-3544-5897 "}, {"title": "Dr", "firstName": "Jingjing", "familyName": "Meng", "roleName": "Partner Investigator", "roleCode": "PI", "isFellowship": false, "orcidIdentifier": "0000-0003-0148-9779 "}], "organisations-current": [{"organisationName": "The University of Newcastle", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "ACT"}, {"organisationName": "Lulea University of Technology", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "organisations-at-announcement": [{"organisationName": "The University of Newcastle", "roleName": "Administering Organisation", "state": "NSW"}, {"organisationName": "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "ACT"}, {"organisationName": "Lulea University of Technology", "roleName": "Other Organisation", "state": "N/A"}], "field-of-research": [{"isPrimary": true, "code": "0905", "name": "Civil Engineering", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "090501", "name": "Civil Geotechnical Engineering", "type": "FOR08"}, {"isPrimary": false, "code": "091402", "name": "Geomechanics and Resources Geotechnical Engineering", "type": "FOR08"}], "socio-economic-objective": [{"code": "840299", "name": "Primary Mining and Extraction of Mineral Resources Not Elsewhere Classified", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "850299", "name": "Mining and Extraction of Energy Resources Not Elsewhere Classified", "type": "SEO08"}, {"code": "870201", "name": "Civil Construction Design", "type": "SEO08"}], "international-collaboration": ["Sweden"], "lief-register": [], "achievement-summary": null}}}, {"links": {"self": "https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/API/grants/DP220103384"}, "data": {"type": "grant-details", "id": "DP220103384", "attributes": {"code": "DP220103384", "administering-organisation": "The University of Sydney", "announcement-administering-organisation": "The University of Sydney", "scheme-name": "Discovery Projects", "grant-status": "Active", "funding-commencement-year": 2022, "years-funded": 3, "project-start-date": "2022-07-04", "anticipated-end-date": "2025-07-03", "grant-summary": "Galactic seismology: a new window on Milky Way's evolution.
